# My custom Neovim setup

As always with an editor, this is a work in progress, it will never be done. My
previous NixOS experience and the wish for a reproducible editor got me here.

Learned a lot from wiltaylor[^1], mjlbach[^2], jordanisaacs[^3] and quoteme[^4].

## Start Neovim

```bash
nix run github:koozz/neovim
```

## Install Neovim

```bash
nix profile install github:koozz/neovim
```
